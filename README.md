# Smart-Weather-Monitoring-and-Prediction-System
Weather monitoring system deals with detecting and gathering various weather parameters which can be analyzed or used for weather forecasting.
The main aim of the project is to develop a smart weather monitoring system.The parameters which would be monitored by the system will include temperature,pressure and humidity of the surroundings.A similar dataset is also visualized in python.
